Pay With your Morality!
- This is a game coded by Amara, Clara and Nathaly
- You are a hero, navigating an enchanted forest. You encounter two mysterious people who begin to attack you vigorously. To escape successfully, you must fight your enemies using your best qualities: friendship, loyalty, etc. You can also switch with your enemy to steal their health levels which is, objectively, morally incorrect. So to win, you must pay with your morality.
